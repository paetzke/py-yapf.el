;; Version: 2016.1

;;; Commentary:

;; Provides commands, which use the external "yapf"
;; tool to tidy up the current buffer according to Python's PEP8.

;; To automatically apply when saving a python file, use the
;; following code:

;;   (add-hook 'python-mode-hook 'py-yapf-enable-on-save)

;;; Code:


(defgroup py-yapf nil
  "Use yapf to beautify a Python buffer."
  :group 'convenience
  :prefix "py-yapf-")


(defcustom py-yapf-options nil
  "Options used for yapf.

Note that `--in-place' is used by default."
  :group 'py-yapf
  :type '(repeat (string :tag "option")))


(defcustom py-yapf-command  "yapf"
  "Name of yapf command to execute."
  :group 'py-yapf
